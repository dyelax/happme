Studies, including an experiment by Facebook, have proven that the content of your news feed can affect your emotions. An overly-negative feed has the potential to cause depression.

We tackle this problem by scraping users' Facebook feeds and assigning them a negative-positive score using HP's Haven OnDemand Sentiment Analysis API. If this score is too low, we alert the user that their feed may be aversely affecting their mood. We can then replace negative posts with cute gifs (guaranteed to improve anyone's day!) or alert a loved one/therapist about the users' exposure to potentially triggering content.
